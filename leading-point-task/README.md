# Investly #

## Important Notes 
- I added redux without integration since there is no endpoint provided
- I added custom hooks as well, but I haven't utilized them yet because there are no events observed on the page, as mentioned in the task documentation.


## Requirements and Setup ##
- NodeJS
- NPM
- Clone Project
- ```npm install```
- ```npm run dev```

## Guidelines & Rules (Moved from here to confluence)
- made variable name and function meaningful and readable
- remove code smells

## Import Aliases
- components = src/components
- store      = src/store
- lib        = src/lib
- hooks      = src/lib/hooks
